GBDA302 Week 2 Example 1: Blob (Breathing Animation)

## Description

This project explores how motion and environment can be used to express emotion through an animated blob. I redesigned the blob’s movement to communicate panic by increasing its speed, wobble, and unpredictability, making its behavior feel nervous and unstable. The environment was expanded into a small interactive map containing objects that the blob can bump into or steal, adding a playful “mischief” mechanic. Together, these changes turn a simple breathing animation into an expressive, emotion-driven interaction.

## Learning Goals

Explore how changes in motion (speed, randomness, deformation) can communicate emotion

Use Perlin noise and movement parameters to create expressive, organic animation

Design a simple interactive environment that responds to character behavior

Implement basic collision and interaction mechanics in p5.js

Understand how small mechanical changes can reinforce emotional storytelling
